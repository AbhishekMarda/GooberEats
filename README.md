<h1> GooberEats </h1>

A turn by turn navigation system made for UCLA's CS 32 (Introduction to Computer Science 2) project 4 for real coordinates across Los Angeles. The file `main.cpp` has been provided by UCLA CS department and the data provided in `mapdata.txt` has been adapted from Open Street Maps (https://www.openstreetmap.org).


In the executable file run `$ ./project4 mapdata.txt deliveries.txt` where mapdata.txt is as provided (or in the same format) and deliveries.txt contains the coordinates for the different deliveries to be made alongside the name, as can be seen in the file. 

The output will be a turn by turn instruction for navigating along an optimized route.
